# Creation in group of The `printf` Function Implementation

Welcome to our custom `printf` function project! ðŸŽ‰

In this project, our goal was to create our own version of the popular `printf` function, commonly used in C for formatted output. We worked as a team to develop a simplified version of `printf` from scratch, handling different format specifiers and output formatting features.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The custom `printf` implementation allows users to print formatted data to the standard output. It can handle various specifiers like `%d`, `%s`, `%c`, and more, while also supporting advanced formatting features like width, precision, and left/right alignment.

The key challenge was to replicate the behavior of the standard `printf` function without directly using it. This involved parsing format specifiers, handling variable arguments, and performing the appropriate output.
