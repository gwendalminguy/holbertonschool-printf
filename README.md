# üöÄ Creation of a Custom `printf` Function

Welcome to our custom `printf` function project! üéâ

In this project, our goal was to create our own version of the popular `printf` function, commonly used in C for formatted output. We worked as a team to develop a simplified version of `printf`, handling different format specifiers and output formatting features.

## üìã Project Overview

This custom `printf` implementation allows users to print formatted data to the standard output. It can handle the basic conversion specifiers such as `%c`, `%s`, `%i` and `%d`, as well as more advanced ones like `%b`, `%o`, `%x`, `%p`, and a few others.

The key challenge was to replicate the behavior of the standard `printf` function without directly using it.

## üõ† Features

This custom `printf` function supports the following features:

- Displaying integers (`int`).
- Displaying characters (`char`).
- Displaying strings (`char *`).
- Displaying addresses (`void *`).
- Handling variadic arguments using `va_list` and `va_arg`.
- Handling specific notations such as binary, octal and hexadecimal.
- Manipulating strings to be reversed or encypted with ROT13.

## ‚öôÔ∏è  Compilation and Restrictions

**The code should be compiled this way:**

`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c`

üí° What does it do?

This command is used to strictly compile all C files in our project.
It helps ensure the code is:

‚úÖ Clean and free from common bugs

‚úÖ Following C89 coding standards

‚úÖ Compiled with any warning treated as an error

**The restrictions are as follows**:

- No more than **5 functions** per file
- No use of global variables
- Authorized functions and macros:

	- `write`
	- `malloc`
	- `free`
	- `va_start`
	- `va_end`
	- `va_copy`
	- `va_arg`

## üß© Use in Code

Let's take a look at what our `_printf` function actually does when implemented in your code with a `char`, a `string` and an `int` conversion specifiers (`%c`, `%s` & `%i`):

```
#include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
	char *language = 'C';
    char *names = "Sofian & Gwendal";
    int year = 2025;

    	_printf("This %c project was brought to you by %s in early %i!\n", language, names, year);
    
	return (0);
}
```

**Now let's take a look at the output:**

`$ This C project was brought to you by Sofian & Gwendal in early 2025!`

## üíæ Use of Memory

The code does not contain any dynamic allocation of the memory.
However, to ensure the code is free of any memory-related issue, a tool such as `Valgrind` can be used on the executable file, after compilation:

```
